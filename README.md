# Clinic-Booking-System-SQL-
# üè• Clinic Booking System (MySQL)

A full-featured relational database system for managing patient appointments, doctors, prescriptions, and room scheduling in a clinical environment.

## üìã Project Description

This project implements a MySQL-based backend for a clinic booking and management system. It allows clinic staff to:
- Register patients and doctors
- Schedule appointments with room assignments
- Record prescriptions
- Manage access through user roles (admin, doctor, receptionist, developer)

The database schema is normalized and supports 1:N and M:N relationships using proper constraints and foreign keys.
